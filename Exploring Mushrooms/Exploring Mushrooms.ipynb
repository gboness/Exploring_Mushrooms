    "   \n",
    "   Spend some time looking over the graphs. Write down exciting insights you find. Here are some examples to get you started:\n",
    "   - It is a roughly equal split between mushrooms that are edible vs. poisonous.\n",
    "   - The majority of mushrooms in this dataset have a scaly surface.\n",
    "   - There are a non-insignificant amount of mushrooms that give off an almond scent?!!!\n",
    "   - Most top surfaces of mushrooms in this dataset are scaly rather than smooth.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Some of your analysis may also require research into mushroom features for any of the x-labels. We hope you enjoy continuing to explore the world of these fun guys!"
